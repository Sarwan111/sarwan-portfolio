		title: "I'm Sarwan Kumar, a DevOps Engineer hailing from Pakistan, dedicated to shaping the future through innovation and technology",
		description:
			"I've had the privilege of contributing to a diverse range of projects throughout my career, and I take pride in the strides we've made together. My experience extends into the realm of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), where I've harnessed critical tools such as Docker, Prometheus, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform to streamline development and operations. In my SRE experience, I've been responsible for ensuring the reliability, scalability, and performance of mission-critical systems.\n\nThis includes implementing proactive monitoring and alerting strategies, conducting post-incident reviews to improve system resilience, and automating routine operational tasks to minimize manual intervention. Furthermore, my journey in the tech world has led me to collaborate extensively with public cloud providers, including AWS (Amazon Web Services), GCP (Google Cloud Platform), and Azure (Microsoft Azure). My proficiency in these cloud ecosystems has allowed me to architect scalable and resilient solutions, further enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of the projects I've been involved in. Whether it's optimizing cloud resources for cost efficiency or implementing robust disaster recovery plans, I've consistently leveraged my SRE expertise to deliver high-performing and reliable systems.",
